```

# Installation and Set-up



```{r cars}
install.packages("plotly")
```

# Contrasting ggplot and plotly Syntax

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
