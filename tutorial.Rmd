# ggplot2 vs. plotly

Last week we learned about ggplot2's grammar of graphics. Today we'll examine how plotly's syntax differs from that of ggplot2. 

## ggplot2

Let's quickly recap ggplot2's grammar of graphics. In most cases you start with `ggplot()`, supply a data set and aesthetic mapping (with `aes()`). You then add on layers (e.g., `geom_point()` or `geom_histogram()`), scales (e.g., `scale_colour_brewer()`), faceting specifications (e.g., `facet_wrap()`) and coordinate systems (e.g., `coord_flip()`).
[(more info >>>)](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

Here's a template for building graphics with ggplot2:
```
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```

Here's an example of ggplot2 in action:
```{r ggplot2, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(iris) + # Add data
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) + # Add mappings
  labs(title = "Petal vs. Sepal Lengths", # Add title & labels
       x = "Petal Length", 
       y = "Sepal Length",
       color = "Species") + # Add legend title
  theme_minimal() # Add theme
```

## plotly 

The grammar of plotly is similar to that of ggplot2. Like ggplot2, you start with a base and add layers. 

### Trace 

In plotly, the base is referred to as a "trace." A trace defines a mapping from data and visuals. Every trace has a type (e.g., histogram, pie, scatter, etc) and the trace type determines what other attributes (i.e., visual and/or interactive properties, like x, hoverinfo, name) are available to control the trace mapping.

To add a layer in the graph, such as fitting a linear regression line, we use `add_trace()`. There is also a family of `add_*()` functions (e.g., `add_histogram()`, `add_lines()`, etc) that define how to render data into geometric objects. [(more info >>>)](https://jtr13.github.io/spring19/community_contribution_group17.html)

List of `add_*()` functions:

* `add_histograms()`
* `add_bars()`
* `add_boxplot()`
* `add_contour()`
* `add_lines()`
* `add_heatmap()`
* `add_scattergeo()`
* `add_pie()`
* and many more...

### Layout

The `layout()` function adds and modifies parts of the plotly graphic. This includes modifying the plot title, legend, margins, size, font, background color, colorscale, and hoverlabels among other features.  

Here's how you would create the plot from above using plotly:  
```{r plotly, fig.align='center'}
library(plotly)

iris %>% # Add data
  # NOTE: You will need to use `~` to map a variable of the data set to an aesthetic parameter
  plot_ly(x = ~Petal.Length, y = ~Sepal.Length, split = ~Species, # Add mappings
        type = 'scatter') %>% # Specify trace type 
  layout(title = 'Petal vs. Sepal Length', # Add title & labels
         xaxis = list(title = 'Petal Length'),
         yaxis = list(title = 'Sepal Length'),          
         legend = list(title = list(text = 'Species')), # Add legend title
         plot_bgcolor = 'white') # Modify background color 
```

Notice that even while the plots look quite similar, the syntax we use to create them can be quite different.


To underscore this point, the table below shows the differences in ggplot2 and plotly grammar: 

| Element 	| ggplot2 	| plotly 	|
|---    |---	|---	|
| Data & Aesthetics	| `ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv))` 	| `plot_ly(data = mpg, x = ~displ, y = ~hwy, color = ~drv)` |
| Geometries 	| `+ geom_point()` 	| `%>% add_markers()` |
| Facets 	| `+ facet_grid(vars(drv), ncol = 1)` 	| `%>% subplot(fig1, fig2)` or use `ggplotly()` |
| Labels 	| `+ labs(x = "Height", y = "Weight", title = "Look at my plot")`	| ` %>% layout(title = 'Look at my plot', xaxis = list(title = 'Height'), yaxis = list(title = 'Weight')` |

### schema( )

The standard documentation retrieved via `?plot_ly()` and specific traces is oftentimes not particularly helpful. You can access a more elaborate documentation via the `schema()` command. Not only is there much more information, the hierarchical list structure also gives a better overview of the underlying logic and syntax of plotly.

```{r schema}
# Check it out!
schema()
```

# Fundamental Plots

While the possibilities with plotly are almost endless, here are several fundamental plots that will likely be useful.  

```{r fundamentals}
# scatterplot 
plot_ly(mpg, x = ~displ, y = ~hwy, color = ~class) %>% 
  add_markers()

# line plot
plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~uempmed) %>% 
  add_paths()

# ribbons
plot_ly(economics, x = ~date) %>%
  add_ribbons(ymin = ~pce - 1e3, ymax = ~pce + 1e3)

# use `add_sf()` or `add_polygons()` to create geo-spatial maps
# http://blog.cpsievert.me/2018/03/30/visualizing-geo-spatial-data-with-sf-and-plotly/
if (requireNamespace("sf", quietly = TRUE)) {
  nc <- sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"), quiet = TRUE)
  plot_ly() %>% add_sf(data = nc)
  }

# univariate summary statistics
# boxplot
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~factor(vs), y = ~mpg) %>%
  add_boxplot()

# violin
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~factor(vs), y = ~mpg) %>%
  add_trace(type = "violin")

# histogram
# `add_histogram()` does binning for you...
diamonds %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~cut) %>% 
  add_histogram()

# bar chart
# ...you can also 'pre-compute' bar heights in R
diamonds %>%
  dplyr::count(cut) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~cut, y = ~n) %>%
  add_bars()

# 2D histogram
library(MASS)
plot_ly(geyser, x = ~waiting, y = ~duration) %>% 
  add_histogram2d()

# 2D histogram contour
plot_ly(geyser, x = ~waiting, y = ~duration) %>% 
  add_histogram2dcontour()

# heatmap 
# (i.e., bin counts must be pre-specified)
den <- kde2d(geyser$waiting, geyser$duration)
plot_ly(x = den$x, y = den$y, z = den$z) %>% 
  add_heatmap()

# heatmap contour
den <- kde2d(geyser$waiting, geyser$duration)
plot_ly(x = den$x, y = den$y, z = den$z) %>% 
  add_contour()

# `add_table()` makes it easy to map a data frame to the table trace type
plot_ly(economics) %>%
  add_table()

# pie chart
ds <- data.frame(labels = c("C", "B", "A"), values = c(10, 40, 60))
plot_ly(ds, labels = ~labels, values = ~values) %>%
  add_pie() %>%
  layout(title = "Basic Pie Chart using Plotly")

# radial pie chart
data(wind)
plot_ly(wind, r = ~r, t = ~t) %>%
  add_area(color = ~nms) %>%
  layout(radialaxis = list(ticksuffix = "%"), orientation = 270)

# 3D surface plot
# Not the most useful trace type but it's still very interesting! 
plot_ly(z = ~volcano) %>%
  add_surface()
```

# ggplotly 

The `ggplotly()` function has the ability to translate ggplot2 to plotly. This functionality can be really helpful for quickly adding interactivity to your existing ggplot2 workflow. Moreover, even if you know plotly well, you can still leverage ggplot2’s consistent and expressive interface for exploring statistical summaries across groups. [(more info >>>)](https://plotly-r.com/overview.html#intro-ggplotly)

Take advantage of ggplotly by plotting a regular ggplot2 graphic and then applying the `ggplotly()` function. Here's an example using the `iris` data set from earlier. 
```{r ggplotly, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

g <- ggplot(iris) + # Add data
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species), # Add mappings
    position = position_jitter()) + # Modify position
  labs(title = "Petal vs. Sepal Lengths",
       x = "Petal Length", # Add title & labels
       y = "Sepal Length",
       color = "Species") + # Add legend title
  theme_minimal() + # Add theme
  theme(legend.position = "right") # Adjust legend position
  
ggplotly(g)
```

# Pro Tips

## Hover Info

Editing the tooltip that shows up when hovering over plotly graphics can be a pain. At the same time, this is typically the first thing you would want to do when creating a plot since the hoverinfo is the most basic interactive feature. 

The key parameters for customizing the tooltip are:

• `hoverinfo`: Using this in combination with the `text`-argument the most straight-forward way to do this.

• `hovertemplate`: takes a particular formula and overwrites whatever is in the hoverinfo. This might be what you are looking for when you also want your formats to correspond with the x-axis format.

• `text`: will add text to the tooltip box. If you wish to delete the displayed hoverinfo, specify `hoverinfo = "text"`. You can add basically everything here, just pay attention to where to put the `~` operator!

There are a number of ways to go about this:
```{r hoverinfo code, message=FALSE}
hover_map <- function(text, 
                      hoverinfo, 
                      hovertemplate, 
                      title) { # Defining function for subsequent mapping
    plot_ly(mtcars,
      x = ~mpg,
      y = ~hp,
      color = ~as.factor(gear),
      text = text,
      hoverinfo = hoverinfo, # Passing hoverinfo here!
      hovertemplate = hovertemplate, # Passing hovertemplate!
      hoverlabel = list( # This is simply to demonstrate how to change the layout of the tooltip. 
        bgcolor = "#348597", # Background colour of the tooltip.
        bordercolor = "transparent", # Contour of the tooltip box
        font = list( # Specifying the font type, size and color
          family = "Times New Roman",
          size = 15,
          color = "white"
        )
      ) # Notice how neither type nor trace are defined. Plotly interprets the passed data as a scatter
    ) %>% 
    layout(
      annotations = # Setting the subplot labels, a workaround as individual subplot titles are not supported :(
        list(
          x = 0.3, 
          y = 1.075, 
          text = title, 
          showarrow = F, 
          xref = 'paper', 
          yref = 'paper')
    ) %>% 
    hide_legend() 
}

hover_list <- list( # Creating a list to pass to pmap(). We will show 4 options
  
  text = list( # Parameters passed to text in the plot_ly call above
    paste0("Just a normal vector </br>", row.names(mtcars)),
    ~paste0(
      "</br> MPG: ", mpg,
      "</br> HP: ", hp,
      "</br> Cyl: ", cyl, 
      "</br>", emo::ji("car")
      ),
    NULL,
    ~qsec
  ),
  
  hoverinfo = list( # Parameters passed to hoverinfo
    NULL,
    "text",
    NULL,
    "text"
  ),
  
  hovertemplate = list( # Parameters passed to hovertemplate
    NULL,
    NULL,
    "The car has %{y:$} HP </br>
    and it has %{x:.1e} MPG.<extra> This is outside the box!</extra>",
    NULL
  ),
  
  title = list( # Subplot titles
    "Passing a vector to hovertext",
    "Custom paste0 formula tooltip",
    "Using hovertemplate",
    "Passing a single variable to hovertext"
  )
  
)

plots <- purrr::pmap(hover_list, hover_map)

hover_plot <- subplot(plots, nrows = 2, shareX = T, shareY = T)
```

```{r hoverinfo plot, echo=FALSE}
hover_plot
```

If you want to simply include variables that are already in the plot (e.g. mapped x, y variables) to the hover text, we would recommend using the `hovertemplate` as it brings you more flexibility and is way easier for customizing the format of the hover text. If there are more variables involved, set `hoverinfo = "text"` and `text = ~paste("whatever", variable, "you wish, using </br> for line breaks!")`. 

**Pay attention:** The tooltip is adjusted differently when using `ggplotly()`. By default all values mapped to `aes()` will be included. to restrict this include `tooltip = "text"` in the ggplotly call. You can also pass a vector to `tooltip`. 

## Linked Plots

As briefly touched upon in the video, the `crosstalk` library is essential for creating linked plots. 

To do so, initiate a `SharedData` object, build the two plots you would like to link and use the `subplot()` command to connect them. You can specify the highlighting type in the `highlight()` command's on-parameter.

```{r linked plots, message=FALSE}
library(crosstalk)

shared_data <- SharedData$new(mtcars) # Creating the shared data object

p1 <- shared_data %>% # Building the first plot
  plot_ly(
    x = ~mpg,
    y = ~hp
  )

p2 <- shared_data %>% # Building the second plot
  plot_ly(
    x = ~qsec,
    y = ~wt
  )

subplot(p1, p2) %>%  # Connecting them with subplot
  highlight(on = "plotly_selected") %>% # Highlighting with box selection
  hide_legend()
```

# Q&A 

```{r Q&A, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/questions.png")
```
